build creates the dist files.
version.txt contains the version used to name the dist files.
clean deletes the dist files.

The plugin source is also hosted at wordpress.org.
We will need to keep the wordpress.org source up to date with new releases.
Access info for the wordpress.org svn repository is:

username: paystand
password: cw$@sc$GfKpF (Needs to be changed to Changing***********4T****s)
svn co http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/woocommerce-paystand woocommerce-paystand
